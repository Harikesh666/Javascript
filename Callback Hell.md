JavaScript is a synchronous single threaded language and it can do just one thing at a time, it has just one callstack and it can execute just one thing at a time. And whatever code you give to JavaScript it will be quickly executed by the JavaScript engine, it does not wait for anything.

console.log("Namaste"); // Namaste

console.log("JavaScript"); // JavaScript

console.log("Season 2"); // Season 2

The above code will be quickly executed by the JavaScript engine and remember that "Time, tide and JavaScript waits for none."

But what if we really need to wait for something ?
