Let's break down the concepts of the *global execution context*, *function execution context*, and the role of `this` in JavaScript more thoroughly, along with examples.

### 1. **Global Execution Context**
   - When any JavaScript code is executed, the *global execution context* is created first.
   - This global execution context includes:
     - The **global object** (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js).
     - The **`this` keyword** set to the global object.
   - Any variables and functions declared outside of functions are part of the **global space** and can be accessed as properties of the global object.

#### Example
```javascript
// Global space
var name = "Global";

function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello " + name);
}

console.log(this.name); // Output: "Global"
console.log(window.name); // Output: "Global" (in browsers)
sayHello(); // Output: "Hello Global"
```

Here:
- The `name` variable is declared in the global space and becomes a property of the global object.
- Since `this` refers to the global object in the global context, `this.name` outputs `"Global"`.

### 2. **Function Execution Context**
   - Every time a function is called, a new **execution context** is created for that function.
   - This function execution context has its own scope, which includes:
     - Local variables.
     - Arguments passed to the function.
     - A **`this` keyword** value that depends on how the function is called.
   
#### Example of `this` in Different Calling Contexts
```javascript
function showThis() {
    console.log(this);
}

// In the global context, `this` refers to the global object:
showThis(); // Output: `window` (in browsers)

// Inside an object method, `this` refers to the object:
const obj = {
    name: "Object",
    showThis: function() {
        console.log(this);
    }
};
obj.showThis(); // Output: `obj` object

// Using `this` in an arrow function inside a method:
const anotherObj = {
    name: "Another Object",
    showThis: () => {
        console.log(this);
    }
};
anotherObj.showThis(); // Output: `window` (in browsers), because arrow functions donâ€™t have their own `this`
```

### 3. **Arrow Functions and `this`**
   - Unlike regular functions, **arrow functions** do not create their own `this` binding. Instead, they inherit `this` from the outer lexical scope where they are defined.
   
#### Example
```javascript
const person = {
    name: "Alice",
    greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
    },
    greetWithArrow: () => {
        console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
    }
};

person.greet(); // Output: "Hello, Alice"
person.greetWithArrow(); // Output: "Hello, undefined" in browsers
```

In this example:
- `greet` uses a regular function, so `this` refers to `person`, outputting `"Hello, Alice"`.
- `greetWithArrow` uses an arrow function, which doesn't have its own `this`, so `this` points to the global object instead.

### 4. **`this` in Different Scenarios**
   - **Global Context**: `this` refers to the global object.
   - **Object Method**: `this` refers to the object the method belongs to.
   - **Event Handlers**: `this` usually refers to the element that triggered the event.
   - **Constructor Functions and Classes**: `this` refers to the newly created object.
   - **Arrow Functions**: `this` is lexically scoped, meaning it inherits `this` from the parent scope where it was defined.

#### Example: `this` in Constructor Functions
```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

const person1 = new Person("John");
console.log(person1.name); // Output: "John"
```

Here, `this` inside the constructor refers to the new instance being created (`person1`).

### Summary Table

| Context                     | Value of `this`          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Global                      | Global object (`window`) |
| Object Method               | Object calling the method|
| Constructor Function        | Newly created instance   |
| Arrow Function              | Lexically inherited      |
| Event Handler               | Element triggering event |

This detailed breakdown covers how execution contexts and `this` behave in JavaScript, which is crucial for effective scoping and function behavior control. Let me know if you have questions on any specific scenario!
