/* 
"Everything in JavaScript happens inside the execution context", you can assume this execution context to be a big box or a container in which whole JS code is executed.

The execution context consists of two parts(components) the Variable environment(memory component), it is a sort of environment in which all the variables and functions are stored in key:value pairs. 

The second component of the execution context is the Thread of Execution (code component), this is the place where code is executed one line at a time.

"JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language", this means that JS can only execute one command at a time and in a specific order, it can only go to the next line once the current line has been executed.

Javascript is not possible without this beautiful execution context

I know you must have heard about AJAX where 'A' stands for asynchronous, but we will come to that later
