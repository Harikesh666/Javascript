### Execution Context in JavaScript
The **execution context** indeed functions as a container or environment where the entire JavaScript code executes, and it has two primary components:

1. **Variable Environment (Memory Component)**:
   - Stores all variables and function declarations as *key-value pairs*.
   - During the **creation phase**, JavaScript allocates memory for variables and functions:
     - **Variable declarations** (e.g., `var`, `let`, `const`) are assigned initial values, usually `undefined` for `var` declarations.
     - **Function declarations** are fully stored in memory, allowing them to be called even before they appear in the code.
   
2. **Thread of Execution (Code Component)**:
   - This is where the code is executed *line by line* during the **execution phase**.
   - As JavaScript runs, it retrieves variable values from the variable environment and updates them with actual values.

#### Phases in Execution Context

1. **Creation Phase**:
   - JavaScript’s engine "skims" through the code to allocate memory.
   - **Hoisting** happens here, where variables and function declarations are stored in memory before the code runs.
   
2. **Execution Phase**:
   - The engine starts executing the code line by line.
   - Variables get actual values based on assignments, and functions are called.

### JavaScript: Synchronous and Single-Threaded

- JavaScript is *single-threaded*, meaning it can only execute one line of code at a time. There’s only one "thread of execution" available, so it can only perform one task at a time.
- It's *synchronous*, which means code runs in a sequence; line 1 executes before line 2, and so on.

### Call Stack: Managing Execution Order

The **call stack** manages the execution contexts and keeps track of function calls, managing which code to run and when. 

- When a function is called, JavaScript creates a new **execution context** and pushes it onto the **call stack**.
- Once the function completes, its execution context is popped off the stack, and the engine resumes execution in the context of the previous function.
  
#### Example of the Call Stack in Action
```javascript
function first() {
    console.log("Inside first function");
    second();
    console.log("Exiting first function");
}

function second() {
    console.log("Inside second function");
}

first();
```

Here’s what happens:
1. `first()` is called, so a new execution context for `first` is created and pushed onto the stack.
2. `first` logs `"Inside first function"`.
3. `second()` is called inside `first()`, so an execution context for `second` is created and pushed on top of the stack.
4. `second` logs `"Inside second function"` and then completes, so its context is popped off the stack.
5. The engine returns to `first`, logs `"Exiting first function"`, and then the `first` context is popped from the stack.

### The Role of AJAX and Asynchronous Code

JavaScript can seem contradictory because we hear about AJAX, asynchronous code, and promises. Here’s how asynchronous behavior fits in:

- Although JavaScript itself is single-threaded, it leverages the **JavaScript runtime environment** (like browsers) to handle asynchronous operations.
- For example, AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests, timers, and DOM events are managed by the **Web APIs** provided by the runtime environment.
- When an asynchronous operation completes, it places a callback function on the **event queue**. The **event loop** constantly checks if the call stack is empty and, if it is, it pushes the callback onto the stack to execute.

This is how JavaScript can handle asynchronous behavior while being single-threaded and synchronous at its core.
