HOC: 
HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a component, at the end of the day it's just a normal javascript function
it takes a component as input and enhances it and returns it back, it acts like a enhancer

HOC are pure func, they will not change the behaviour of the input function (code or something), but just enhance it 

an imp aprt of a react app is to manage its data, in any ui or react apps, ui is static it doesnt have logic of its own, data is another part of apps and data has its own layer, ui layer is powered by data layer , the data layer consists of props, states, local varaiable, the data you have in your app is data layer and the ui is powered by the data layer, data layer is v important if you know hot to manager the data correctly in react app , your apps will be super fast and v performant, when i say ui ;layer it mostly consists of jsx and data layer is props, state, local variables and the curly braces inside your jsx that js code that you write is modifying the data layer

controlled & uncontrolled comps:

```jsx

const RestaurantCategory = ({ data }) => {
    const [showItems, setShowItems] = useState(false);

    const handleClick = () => {
        setShowItems(!showItems);
    };
 
    return (
        <div>
            {/* Accordion Header */}

```jsx
// RestaurantMenu.js
import Shimmer from "./Shimmer";
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
import useRestaurantMenu from "../utils/useRestaurantMenu";
import RestaurantCategory from "./RestaurantCategory";

const RestaurantMenu = () => {
    const { resId } = useParams();

    const resInfo = useRestaurantMenu(resId);

    if (resInfo === null) return <Shimmer />;

    const { name, cuisines, costForTwoMessage } =
        resInfo?.data?.cards[2]?.card?.card?.info || {};

    const { itemCards } =

            (c) =>
                c.card?.card?.["@type"] ===
                "type.googleapis.com/swiggy.presentation.food.v2.ItemCategory"
        );

    return (
        <div className="text-center m-3">
            <h1 className="font-bold my-4 text-2xl">{name}</h1>
            <p className="font-bold text-lg">
                {cuisines.join(", ")} - {costForTwoMessage}
            </p>
            {/* categories accordion */}
            {categories.map((category) => (
                <RestaurantCategory key={category?.card?.card.title}  data={category?.card?.card} showItems={false} />

RestaurantMenu is a parent and it has a lot of category, and i want the parent to control it's children, if i say show item it should show and if i say hide item it should hide, if i pass in false it should not show and if i pass in true it should show, i dont want my RestaurantCategory to has it's own state, but it should take my showitems from my props, so if i pass in my showitem as false then show my item list and if i pass in true it should not show

so this is a controlled component now, RestaurantCategory is a controlled component now because RestaurantMenu is controlling this RestaurantCategory now it is controlled component, when it had its own state it was an uncontrolled component because RestaurantMenu did not have its controled if it wants to show or hide something it can do itself, this was not controlled it was controlling itself so it was an uncont component, the parent was not controlling its children, the RestaurantMenu did not have full control over RestaurantCategory 

if RestaurantCategory was controlling itself it would have been an uncontrolled component and if i take away that power then it is an controlled component because it is relying on it's parent to tell it what to do

RestaurantCategory is a controlled component that means i can control it via props, it does not have it's own state, it can have it's own state but it's not the main state as it's majorly controlled by it's parent 
if it was managing itself than it would have been uncontrolled component

there is no specific definition of controlled/un-concontrolled it is just a philosophy 

lifting state up in react :

props drilling:
it means in a real world react app there are lots of comps and they have a different heirarchy, in our app when it grows there are comps and there are comps within them and it's like a big tree struct and there are a lot of levels of nesting inside it and passing data from one comp to another is a one big challenge when the app is huge, and react has one way data flow: in react the data is passed from parents to children and then children to their children, similarly data flows in one direction from top to bottom, suppose we have a restmenu page so this resmenu page passes data to rescate and this rescat passes data to itemlist 

suppose if there is some dummy data inside resmenu, we have created some dummy data on the top level , suppose now i want to pass this data to the leaf of that tree, i want to access that data inside my itemlist, suppose i want the dummy data in my itemlist how will i fetch that data ? i can't directly pass the data, i have to pass the data via it's intermediate parent, so first of all i'll have to pass this data to my rescate, and recsae will recieve this data and the data will be passed to rescate children and now i can access this data in my itemlist, so basically i'm just passing my data as a prop 

but think of a very big react app which has a deep level of nesting and there are like 7-8 level of nesting and you have to pass data from the parent to the end children, will you follow the pattern by passing the data as props to intermmediate comps, 

this whole concept is known as prop drilling because you are drilling the props, drilling it down to the bottom, it is the problem with passing props  

props is a very important essential of react, state and props are very important in react without state and props react comp does not exist, and without comps nothing exists, everything is a comp in react and everybody knows that and comps have their own state and props, that's what a comp is built off, but we should avoid prop drilling, suppose if we have to pass data upto one or two levels this is still okay, but what if the data is present somewhere and we want to access it somewhere else, how would we do that ?, and in a large app this is a very common scenario where sometimes we need to have some kind of a global data, that i can access anywhere in my app wherevr i am, whatever nested level i am, i want to  access some data, how can we do that ? for that react gives us a superpower and that superpower is known as react context 

react gives us access to react context and while we use context we can avoid props drilling, we should not be passing anything, we use context which is kind of like a global place where your data is kept and anybody can access it, this is known as react context 

context solves the problem of props drilling, if we had a central store where we can keep the data we won't need to drill down the props and access the data anywhere i want to 

useContext = to use the context
createContext = to create the context

```jsx
import { createContext } from "react";

const UserContext = createContext({
    loggedInUser: "Default User",
});

export default UserContext;
```
```jsx
import { useContext } from "react";

const data = useContext(UserContext);
```

in our whole react app there is not just one context we can create , we can create as many as we want to 

should we keep all the data inside context ? then there will be no need for props, but that's not the case, only the data which you are using at multiple places or which you feel can be used at multiple places that is where we use context

in class based components we use context by using

<UserContext.Consumer> // this is a component
    {({loggedInUser})=> <h1>{loggedInUser}</h1>} //used inside jsx
</UserContext.Consumer>

it takes a callback function and this callback function gives you the access to the context

when you create a context react gives you the power of consumer as well, so you have two ways to access the context one is by hook and the other is by using UserContext.Consumer, both are the ways to consume context 

in real life this is the default value of the context, what if we want to change the value of the userContext 

suppose i want to pass new information in my context i will use contextProvider

```jsx
const AppLayout = () => {
    const [userName, setUserName] = useState();
    // authentication
    useEffect(() => {
        // make an api call and send the username and password
        const data = {
            name: "Harikesh Mishra",
        };
        setUserName(data.name);
    }, []);

    return (
        <UserContext.Provider value={{loggedInUser: userName}}>
            <div className="app">
                <Header />
                <Outlet />
            </div>
        </UserContext.Provider> 
    );
};
```
we have got our context and we are providing a new value to it, and i'm providing it to whole app
i have wrapped my whole app inside UserContext.Provider that means anywhere inside my app we have the UserContext.Provider the vakue will be this value={{loggedInUser: userName}}, now our components will not be using the default value, now the context will be using, wherever i'm using loggedInUser the loggedInUser value will be the new value, basically i'm overwriting the default value of my context, and since i have wrapped my whole app inside the UserContext.Provider, everywhere my new user will be Harikesh Mishra

suppose if wrap just my header 
```jsx
const AppLayout = () => {
    const [userName, setUserName] = useState();
    // authentication
    useEffect(() => {
        // make an api call and send the username and password
        const data = {
            name: "Harikesh Mishra",
        };
        setUserName(data.name);
    }, []);

    return (
        <div className="app">
            <UserContext.Provider value={{loggedInUser: userName}}>
                <Header />
            </UserContext.Provider>
            <Outlet />
        </div> 
    );
};
```
so this new value will only be present inside my header and everywhere else my default value will be used, so basically i can also use my Provider for a specific portion 

this is the power of context, context is a global space that i can provide to whole app or just a small portion of our app, i can create a new context for header or somwhere else and i can overwrite anywhere i want to 

we can also do something like this

```jsx
const AppLayout = () => {
    const [userName, setUserName] = useState();
    // authentication
    useEffect(() => {
        // make an api call and send the username and password
        const data = {
            name: "Harikesh Mishra",
        };
        setUserName(data.name);
    }, []);

    return (
        {/* Default Value  */}
        <UserContext.Provider value={{ loggedInUser: userName }}>
        {/* Harikesh Mishra */}
            <div className="app">
                <UserContext.Provider value={{ loggedInUser: userName }}>
                {/* Elon Musk */}
                    <Header />
                </UserContext.Provider>
                <Outlet />
            </div>
        </UserContext.Provider>
    );
};
```
this is a perfectly valid code now our header will use Elon Musk and everywhere else of our app will be using Harikesh Mishra, it depends on where you have provided your useContext

we can also pass the setUserName to the context
```jsx
const AppLayout = () => {
    const [userName, setUserName] = useState();
    // authentication
    useEffect(() => {
        // make an api call and send the username and password
        const data = {
            name: "Harikesh Mishra",
        };
        setUserName(data.name);
    }, []);

    return (
        <div className="app">
            <UserContext.Provider value={{loggedInUser: userName, setUserName}}>
                <Header />
            </UserContext.Provider>
            <Outlet />
        </div> 
    );
};
```
in this way we can use setUserName in other components and use it to change the userName
