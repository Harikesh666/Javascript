Redux works in the data layer of our application

Redux is not mandatory, when youre building small or mid-sized app you dont need redux but when youre building a large size app where the data is heavily used where the lot of read and write operations are happening in your ui app, in your react app there are a lot of component 

redux is a seperate library from react, use redux wisely and only when it is required, it is not the only library used for managing state, there is also zustand

zustand is also used for state management, it's quite lightweight 

when we use redux our apps become easy to debug

redux offers state mangement 

there are two libraries that redux team offers namely react-redux and redux toolkit

redux store is a big js obj and it is kept in a global central place and we keep most of the major data of our app in the redux store 

the redux store has slices inside it, each slice is a logical partition with each slice containing logic about a single function or feature 

how does the data go inside the slice ?
we have to dispatch an action, it calls a function and this function internally modifies the cart
Action -> fn() -> modifies the cart

what is this fn() actually ?
it is known as a reducer 
when we dispatch an action, which calls a reducer fn(), which updates the slice of our redux store 
Action -> reducer fn() -> modifies the cart

and then our slice will be updated, the data will be added to our slice

suppose now i want to read data ?
we use something known as a selector to read the data from our store and this selector will give you the data

when we use selector to subscribe to the store this phenomena is known as subscribing to the store 

Add BTN(click) -> dispatch an action -> reducer fn() -> updates the slice of our store 

and the cart comp is subscribed to the store using a selector 

we use {configureStore} to configure our store which we import from redux toolkit as configuring/creating a store is a redux thing

we use {Provider} to provide the store our app which we import from react-redux as it is like a bridge between our react app and redux 

this Provider takes store as a prop

what is a action ?
adding, removing, clearing these things are actions, think of them as apis to commuincate with the store

the reducer function has two parameters namely the state and action

(state, action) it will modify the state based on the action, we are directly modifying the state, mutating the existing state 

onClick={handleClick}
onClick={() => handleClick(item)}
onClick={handleClick(item)}

if you don't subscribe to the right portion of the store it will be a big performance loss 

redux is an external library and sometimes external libraries comes with a lot of burden of learning 

redux uses immer library
