# React Hooks & Routing: In-Depth Overview

This section provides a detailed explanation of React's `useEffect` and `useState` hooks along with insights into routing in React applications. The information is structured to give you both the basic usage and advanced considerations.

---

## 1. useEffect Hook

The `useEffect` hook is essential for handling side effects in functional components. It allows you to execute code after a component renders, such as fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or logging.

### Basic Usage

- **Syntax:**  
  `useEffect` is invoked with two arguments:
  1. A **callback function** that contains the side effect code.
  2. A **dependency array** that controls when the effect runs.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("useEffect");
}, []);
```

### Behavior Details

- **Default Behavior:**  
  - When no dependency array is provided, the callback is executed after every render.
  - *Example:*  
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("This will run after every render");
    });
    ```
    
- **With an Empty Dependency Array:**  
  - When you pass an empty dependency array (`[]`), the effect is executed only once, after the initial render.
  - This pattern is often used for one-time actions like initializing data or subscriptions.
    
- **With Dependencies:**  
  - When dependencies are included, the effect runs only when one or more of those dependencies change.
  - This provides control over when the side effect should be re-triggered, making the component more efficient.
  - *Example:*  
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("This runs only when dependency changes");
    }, [dependency]);
    ```

### Practical Considerations

- **Avoiding Unnecessary Executions:**  
  - Always consider including the dependency array to prevent the effect from running on every render unless that behavior is required.
  
- **Cleanup Functions:**  
  - When using effects that subscribe to external events or resources, return a cleanup function to avoid memory leaks.
  - *Example:*  
    ```jsx
    useEffect(() => {
        const timer = setInterval(() => console.log("tick"), 1000);
        return () => clearInterval(timer);
    }, []);
    ```

## 2. useState Hook

The `useState` hook allows you to add local state to functional components. It provides a way to declare state variables that trigger re-rendering when updated.

### Basic Usage

- **Declaration:**  
  - State variables must be declared at the top level of your functional component.  
  - *Example:*  
    ```jsx
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    ```
    
### Rules and Best Practices

- **Placement:**  
  - **Always** call `useState` at the top of your component, not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
  - **Reason:** Hooks rely on the order in which they are called, and placing them inside conditional blocks or loops can lead to inconsistencies and errors such as "Invalid hook call."

- **Do Not Use Outside Component Scope:**  
  - Attempting to use `useState` outside a functional component will result in an error.
  
- **Avoiding Conditional or Loop-Based Declarations:**  
  - Although it may seem valid to call `useState` inside an if-else or loop, doing so can cause the state to be initialized conditionally, breaking the predictable hook order.
  - *Example of what to avoid:*  
    ```jsx
    if (someCondition) {
      const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
    }
    ```
  - Instead, declare all state variables at the top level and conditionally update them as needed.

### Practical Considerations

- **Single Source of Truth:**  
  - State variables represent the dynamic part of your UI, ensuring that when they change, the component re-renders to reflect the latest data.
  
- **Predictability in Functional Components:**  
  - Keeping state declarations at the top level helps maintain the predictable behavior of hooks, aligning with React's design principles.

## 3. Routing in React Applications

React applications are typically built as **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**. This means the entire application is loaded once, and navigating between views involves swapping components rather than reloading the entire page.

### Types of Routing

#### Client-Side Routing

- **Description:**  
  - All components and routes are already loaded into the application, and routing is managed within the browser.
  - No additional network calls are made for navigation.
  
- **Benefits:**  
  - Faster navigation as only the components change.
  - Smoother transitions since the page does not refresh.
  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Common libraries include React Router, which allows you to define routes and render components dynamically.

#### Server-Side Routing

- **Description:**  
  - Each navigation action makes a network request to the server, which then returns the appropriate HTML and data.
  - This approach results in a full page reload.
  
- **Benefits:**  
  - Useful for scenarios where SEO is critical and each route should be fully rendered on the server.
  - Simplifies certain aspects of state management on initial load.
  
- **Considerations:**  
  - Slower navigation due to the full reload of pages.

#### Dynamic Routing

- **Description:**  
  - In dynamic routing, routes are generated based on parameters or content.
  - Each dynamic route is constructed on the fly, often using a pattern that matches multiple possible paths.
  
- **Examples:**  
  - User profiles (e.g., `/users/:id`) where the `:id` parameter dynamically loads user-specific content.
  
- **Benefits:**  
  - Flexibility to handle a variety of routes without having to statically define each one.
  - Enhanced user experience when handling multiple similar routes efficiently.
