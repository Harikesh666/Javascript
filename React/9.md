# Single Responsibility Principle, Custom Hooks, and Lazy Loading in React

This document explains several key concepts for building modular, maintainable, and performant React applications. It covers the Single Responsibility Principle, the benefits of breaking code into small testable pieces, the creation of custom hooks to abstract logic, and strategies such as code splitting and lazy loading for large-scale applications.

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle

### Overview

- **Concept:**  
  Every function, class, or component should have only one responsibility. For example, if you have a component called `RestaurantMenu`, its only job should be to display the restaurant menu.

- **Benefits:**  
  - **Modularity:**  
    Breaking your code into smaller pieces makes it modular.
  - **Testability:**  
    When each piece has a single responsibility, you can test each piece in isolation and catch bugs more easily.
  - **Maintainability and Reusability:**  
    Following the single responsibility principle means your code becomes more reusable, maintainable, and easier to read. Although there is no hard and fast rule, the goal is to keep your components as light as possible so that someone reading your code can quickly understand its purpose.

## 2. Custom Hooks

### What Are Hooks?

- **Definition:**  
  Hooks are essentially normal JavaScript functions provided by React to manage state, side effects, and more in functional components. They can be thought of as utility functions that help encapsulate behavior.

### Creating Custom Hooks

- **Purpose:**  
  Custom hooks allow you to abstract and extract logic from your components. This leads to more modular, reusable, and readable code. Although creating a custom hook is not mandatory, it can improve the organization of your code by removing data fetching or other logic from the component itself.

- **Example Scenario:**  
  Instead of having a `RestaurantMenu` component manage its own data fetching and state, you can extract that logic into a custom hook.

### Example: Original Component with Data Fetching

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import Shimmer from "./Shimmer";
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
import { MENU_API } from "../utils/constants";

const RestaurantMenu = () => {
    const [resInfo, setResInfo] = useState(null);
    const { resId } = useParams();

    useEffect(() => {
        fetchMenu();
    }, []);

    const fetchMenu = async () => {
        const data = await fetch(`${MENU_API}${resId}`);
        const json = await data.json();
        setResInfo(json);
    };

    if (resInfo === null) return <Shimmer />;

    const { name, cuisines, costForTwoMessage } =
        resInfo?.data?.cards[2]?.card?.card?.info || {};

    const { itemCards } =
        resInfo?.data?.cards[4]?.groupedCard?.cardGroupMap?.REGULAR?.cards[1]
            ?.card.card;

    return (
        <div className="menu">
            <h1>{name}</h1>
            <p>
                {cuisines.join(", ")} - {costForTwoMessage}
            </p>
            <h2>Menu</h2>
            <ul>
                {itemCards.map((item) => (
                    <li key={item?.card?.info?.id}>
                        {item?.card?.info?.name} -{" "}
                        {item?.card?.info?.defaultPrice / 100 ||
                            item?.card?.info?.price / 100}{" "}
                        Rs
                    </li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
};

export default RestaurantMenu;
```

### Example: Extracting the Data Fetching Logic into a Custom Hook

```jsx
// useRestaurantMenu.js
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { MENU_API } from "../utils/constants";

const useRestaurantMenu = (resId) => {
    const [resInfo, setResInfo] = useState(null);

    // Fetch data once the component using this hook mounts
    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchData = async () => {
            const data = await fetch(MENU_API + resId);
            const json = await data.json();
            setResInfo(json);
        };

        fetchData();
    }, [resId]); // Re-run if the restaurant ID changes

    return resInfo;
};

export default useRestaurantMenu;
```

### Benefits of the Custom Hook

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  The `RestaurantMenu` component now focuses solely on displaying the restaurant menu on the UI. It no longer worries about data fetching or managing its own state.
- **Modularity and Maintainability:**  
  The code becomes easier to maintain and test because the logic for fetching data is isolated. If a bug arises in the data fetching logic, you know exactly where to look.
- **Reusability:**  
  The custom hook can be reused in other components that require the same data fetching logic.

## 3. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

### Overview

- **Challenge with Large-Scale Apps:**  
  In large-scale applications with thousands of components, bundlers may compress all components into a single huge file. This large bundle can hurt performance, particularly on the initial load.

- **Solution: Code Splitting:**  
  Break down your application into smaller chunks. This process is known as chunking, code splitting, dynamic bundling, lazy loading, or dynamic import. It allows you to create smaller bundles that load on demand.

### Lazy Loading

- **Definition:**  
  Lazy loading ensures that code for a specific component is loaded only when it is needed rather than at the initial load.

- **Example of Lazy Loading a Component:**

  ```jsx
  import { lazy, Suspense } from "react";
  import Shimmer from "./Shimmer";

  const Grocery = lazy(() => import("./components/Grocery"));

  // In your routing or component tree
  const AppRoutes = () => (
      <Route
          path="/grocery"
          element={
              <Suspense fallback={<Shimmer />}>
                  <Grocery />
              </Suspense>
          }
      />
  );
  ```

### How Lazy Loading Works

- **Separate Bundle:**  
  The code for the `Grocery` component is split into its own bundle and is not included in the main bundle.  
- **Fallback UI:**  
  While the `Grocery` component is loading, the `Suspense` component displays a fallback UI (like the `Shimmer` component). This prevents React from throwing an error due to the delay in loading the code.
- **On-Demand Loading:**  
  The component code is loaded only when the user navigates to the `/grocery` route, improving the overall performance of your application by reducing the initial load time.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive guide covered several advanced concepts:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle:**  
   - Each component or function should have one clear responsibility.  
   - This leads to modular, testable, and maintainable code.

2. **Custom Hooks:**  
   - Hooks are just JavaScript functions with special behavior provided by React.  
   - Creating custom hooks helps abstract logic (like data fetching) from components, keeping them focused solely on UI rendering.

3. **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading:**  
   - For large-scale applications, breaking your code into smaller bundles through techniques like lazy loading is essential.  
   - Lazy loading improves performance by loading component code only when needed and using a fallback UI during loading.

By following these practices, your codebase becomes more modular, efficient, and easier to test and maintain. This is especially important as your application scales in size and complexity.
