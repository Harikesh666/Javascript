Let's delve deeper into each example and examine how closures, the `setTimeout` function, and JavaScript’s variable scoping impact the behavior of each piece of code.

### Example 1: Simple `setTimeout` with `var`

```javascript
function x() {
    var i = 1;
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
}
x();
```

**Explanation**

1. **Closure Mechanics**:
   - The `setTimeout` function creates a closure over `i`, the variable declared within `function x`.
   - Since `var` is function-scoped, `i` exists in the entire scope of `function x`. The callback function in `setTimeout` closes over this scope, retaining access to `i` even after `x()` finishes executing.

2. **Execution Flow**:
   - JavaScript moves to the `setTimeout` call, scheduling the anonymous function to run after 1000ms (1 second). However, JavaScript doesn't pause here; it continues executing the next line immediately.
   - Since `setTimeout` only schedules the function to run later, the function itself does not execute until the timer has elapsed.

3. **Callback Execution**:
   - After 1 second, the callback function is executed. At this point, `i` is still `1` because we haven’t changed its value since it was set. The console therefore logs `1`.

#### Output

```
1
```

### Example 2: Immediate Log with Delayed `setTimeout`

```javascript
function x() {
    var i = 1;
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(i);
    }, 3000);
    console.log("Time, Tide and JavaScript waits for none");
}
x();
```

**Explanation**

1. **Closure**: The callback function within `setTimeout` closes over `i`, retaining a reference to it.
2. **Execution Flow**:
   - `setTimeout` schedules the callback function to run after 3 seconds.
   - Meanwhile, JavaScript doesn’t wait for this delay to complete and immediately executes the next line, printing `"Time, Tide and JavaScript waits for none"`.
3. **Callback Execution**:
   - After 3 seconds, `setTimeout` completes, and the callback function runs. Because `i` remains `1` (no other changes were made to it), `1` is printed.

#### Output

```
Time, Tide and JavaScript waits for none
1
```

### Example 3: `for` Loop with `setTimeout` Using `var`

```javascript
function x() {
    for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            console.log(i);
        }, i * 1000);
    }
    console.log("Namaste");
}
x();
```

**Explanation**

1. **Loop Execution and Scope of `var`**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = 5`. For each iteration, `setTimeout` is scheduled with a delay that depends on `i` (1 second for `i=1`, 2 seconds for `i=2`, etc.).
   - Since `var` is function-scoped, each iteration of `setTimeout` in the loop closes over the same variable `i` within `function x`.
   - By the time the first `setTimeout` callback executes, the loop has already completed and `i` has been incremented to `6`.

2. **Closure Behavior**:
   - Each `setTimeout` call shares the same `i` reference due to `var`'s function scope, meaning all five callbacks capture the final value of `i`, which is `6`.

3. **Immediate Execution of Console Log**:
   - The `"Namaste"` log statement outside of the `setTimeout` calls executes immediately after scheduling all the `setTimeout` functions.

4. **Delayed Execution**:
   - Each of the five `setTimeout` callbacks executes after the specified delay, but they all log the same value (`6`) because they share a single closure with `i`.

#### Output

```
Namaste
6
6
6
6
6
```

### Example 4: `for` Loop with `let` for Block Scoping

```javascript
function x() {
    for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        setTimeout(function () {
            console.log(i);
        }, i * 1000);
    }
    console.log("Namaste");
}
x();
```

**Explanation**

1. **`let` Block Scope**:
   - When `let` is used, each iteration of the loop has its own unique `i` within its block scope.
   - This means each `setTimeout` call inside the loop captures its own version of `i`, rather than sharing a single one as with `var`.
   
2. **Closure Behavior**:
   - Each `setTimeout` callback creates a closure over the specific `i` for that iteration, maintaining the value of `i` as it was at that point in the loop.

3. **Execution Flow**:
   - The `"Namaste"` statement is logged immediately, as before.
   - Each `setTimeout` callback then logs its own `i` after the specified delay (1 second for `i=1`, 2 seconds for `i=2`, etc.).

#### Output

```
Namaste
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Example 5: Helper Function with `var`

```javascript
function x() {
    for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        function close(i) {
            setTimeout(function() {
                console.log(i);
            }, i * 1000);
        } 
        close(i); 
    }
    console.log("Namaste");
}
x();
```

**Explanation**

1. **Using a Helper Function to Capture `i`**:
   - Here, we use a helper function `close(i)` that receives `i` as an argument.
   - Inside `close(i)`, the `setTimeout` function is called, which closes over the value of `i` passed to `close`.

2. **Closure Behavior**:
   - Each call to `close(i)` captures the current value of `i` for that specific loop iteration.
   - The `setTimeout` inside `close` thus logs the `i` that was passed into `close`.

3. **Execution Flow**:
   - "Namaste" is printed immediately.
   - Then, each `setTimeout` callback logs `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5` after delays of 1 second, 2 seconds, and so on.

#### Output

```
Namaste
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Example 6: Helper Function with Modified Variable Name

```javascript
function x() {
    for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        function close(x) {
            setTimeout(function() {
                console.log(x);
            }, x * 1000);
        } 
        close(i); 
    }
    console.log("Namaste");
}
x();
```

**Explanation**

1. **Helper Function with Different Parameter Name**:
   - This example is similar to the previous one, but here we use `x` as the parameter in `close` instead of `i`.
   - When calling `close(i)`, the current value of `i` is passed and captured by `x` inside the helper function.
   
2. **Closure Behavior**:
   - Each `setTimeout` callback created inside `close(x)` captures a unique value of `x` for each iteration of the loop, effectively fixing the value of `x` for each delayed callback.

3. **Execution Flow**:
   - "Namaste" logs immediately.
   - Each `setTimeout` callback then logs `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5` sequentially.

#### Output

```
Namaste
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Summary

These examples illustrate the importance of closures, variable scope, and timing in JavaScript. When `var` is used, all `setTimeout` callbacks reference the same variable due to function scope. Using `let` creates a new scope for each loop iteration, resulting in independent closures. Helper functions allow us to simulate block scoping even with `var` by capturing the current loop variable as a function argument.
